    converge!(workspace; <keyword arguments>)

Auxiliary method that implements epsilon scaling to approximate the
unregularized problem.

## Arguments:
  - `start_eps = nothing`. Initial value of epsilon. By default, the current `epsilon` of `workspace` is used.
  - `target_eps = nothing`. Target value of epsilon. By default, determined indirectly via `target_blur`.
  - `target_blur = nothing`. Target value of the average blur of the transport plan. Either this value or `target_eps` should be passed explicitly.
  - `scaling = 0.9`. Factor by which epsilon is reduced per scaling step.
  - `tolerance = 1e-2`. Convergence tolerance to be achieved before `epsilon` is scaled down.
  - `target_tolerance = tolerance`. Convergence tolerance for the final scaling step.
  - `max_time = 600`. Maximal time in seconds that the function is allowed to run.
  - `max_steps = 10000`. Maximal number of steps that the function is allowed to conduct.
  - `callback`. Procedure that is called after each Sinkhorn step.
  - `callback_scaling`. Procedure that is called after each (partial) convergence.
  - `verbose = false`. If true, the function documents its progress.
